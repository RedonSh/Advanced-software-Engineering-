Create more md files like this one as needed. Place them into the same folder 
as this [user_stories folder](./)

# User story title: e.g. Show current deals

Keep any other version here as well, e.g. Display current deals, Let user to click on "show-current-deals".

## Priority: 10 (e.g. latest for iteration-1)
Any notes on priority go here. 
Note you may have different priorities at different stages of you project.
Again, keep all changes here for marking.

## Estimation: e.g. 2 days
Any notes on estimation go here. Keep your planning poker game numbers. For example
* Bob: 1 day (e.g. estimated before iteration-1)
* Lisa: 2 days
* Jack: 3 days

## Assumptions (if any):

## Description: e.g. The web page will show current deals to Orion's orbits users
You need to keep all versions here so that your instructor/marker can see your changes easily. 
In a real project, your older versions could be viewed via commits.

Description-v1: e.g. The web site will show current deals to Orion's orbits users

## Tasks, see chapter 4.

#### Auth and Profile
As a user, I can register and log in, so that my pantry, preferences, and saved recipes are secure and personalized. 

As a user, I can set my dietary restrictions and nutrition goals (e.g., vegan, halal, low-sodium), so that the app only suggests recipes that fit my needs.

#### Pantry Management
- As a user, I can add, edit, or remove pantry items with quantity, unit, and expiry date, so that I know what ingredients I have at home.
- As a user, I can see suggestions for commonly used pantry items, so that adding items is faster.
- As a user, I want the app to highlight items that are expired or running low, so I avoid cooking failures and waste.

#### Recipe Generation
- As a user, I can generate recipes based on my pantry items and dietary constraints, so that I can cook meals with what I have.
- As a user, I want recipes to indicate preparation time, servings, and steps, so that I can plan efficiently.
- As a user, I want allergens flagged and dietary compliance enforced, so that I can safely follow my restrictions.


# UI Design:
* (New, not in the textbook) 
* Many user stories are connected to a User interface.
* Insert a mockup design screenshot using any prototyping tools, e.g. [https://ninjamock.com/](https://ninjamock.com/)

# Completed:
* (New, not in the textbook) 
* Insert screenshots of completed. 
* If you have multiple versions (changes between iteractions), show them all.
