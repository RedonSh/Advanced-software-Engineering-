# User story title: Pantry Management
As a user, I want to manage my pantry items so I can keep track of what I currently have and organise them efficiently.

## Priority: 1 (e.g. latest for iteration-1)
Any notes on priority go here. 
Note you may have different priorities at different stages of you project.
Again, keep all changes here for marking.

## Estimation: 3 days
Any notes on estimation go here. Keep your planning poker game numbers. For example
* Nathan: 8 days (e.g. estimated before iteration-1)
* Radahn: 1 day
* Sabjay: 1 day
* Tobden: 1/2 day

## Assumptions (if any):

* Learning to implement the database may take awhile.
* Users have already registered and logged in.

## Description: e.g. The web page will show current deals to Orion's orbits users
The site will require the user to login to the app/product

Description-v1: e.g. The web site will show current deals to Orion's orbits users

## Tasks, see chapter 4.
1 **Create Pantry Page Layout** – Estimation: 1 day  
2. **Add/Edit/Delete Pantry Items** – Estimation: 2 days  
3. **Implement Sorting and Filtering** – Estimation: 1 day
