# User story title: e.g. Auth & Profile, Pantry Management, Recipe Generation 



## Priority: 10 (e.g. latest for iteration-1)
Any notes on priority go here. 
Note you may have different priorities at different stages of you project.
Again, keep all changes here for marking.
- The most important featured worked on being the Login page
- 

## Estimation: e.g. 2 Weeks
Any notes on estimation go here. Keep your planning poker game numbers. For example

### Login page: 2.3 days
### Recipe Generation: 8 days
### Pantry Management: 4 days

## Assumptions (if any):
- Learning to implement may take awhile.

## Description: e.g. The web page will show current deals to Orion's orbits users
You need to keep all versions here so that your instructor/marker can see your changes easily. 
In a real project, your older versions could be viewed via commits.

Description-v1: e.g. The web site will show current deals to Orion's orbits users

## Tasks, see chapter 4.

- Auth and Profile
  - As a user, I can register and log in, so that my pantry, preferences, and saved recipes are secure and personalized.
  - As a user, I can set my dietary restrictions and nutrition goals (e.g., vegan, halal, low-sodium), so that the app only suggests recipes that fit my needs.

- Pantry Management
  - As a user, I can add, edit, or remove pantry items with quantity, unit, and expiry date, so that I know what ingredients I have at home.
  - As a user, I can see suggestions for commonly used pantry items, so that adding items is faster.
  - As a user, I want the app to highlight items that are expired or running low, so I avoid cooking failures and waste.

- Recipe Generation
  - As a user, I can generate recipes based on my pantry items and dietary constraints, so that I can cook meals with what I have.
  - As a user, I want recipes to indicate preparation time, servings, and steps, so that I can plan efficiently.
  - As a user, I want allergens flagged and dietary compliance enforced, so that I can safely follow my restrictions.

* Insert a mockup design screenshot using any prototyping tools, e.g. [https://ninjamock.com/](https://ninjamock.com/)

# Completed:
* (New, not in the textbook) 
* Insert screenshots of completed. 
* If you have multiple versions (changes between iteractions), show them all.
