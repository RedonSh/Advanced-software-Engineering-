## User stories or tasks (see chapter 4):

#### Auth and Profile
As a user, I can register and log in, so that my pantry, preferences, and saved recipes are secure and personalized. 

As a user, I can set my dietary restrictions and nutrition goals (e.g., vegan, halal, low-sodium), so that the app only suggests recipes that fit my needs.

#### Pantry Management
- As a user, I can add, edit, or remove pantry items with quantity, unit, and expiry date, so that I know what ingredients I have at home.
- As a user, I can see suggestions for commonly used pantry items, so that adding items is faster.
- As a user, I want the app to highlight items that are expired or running low, so I avoid cooking failures and waste.

#### Recipe Generation
- As a user, I can generate recipes based on my pantry items and dietary constraints, so that I can cook meals with what I have.
- As a user, I want recipes to indicate preparation time, servings, and steps, so that I can plan efficiently.
- As a user, I want allergens flagged and dietary compliance enforced, so that I can safely follow my restrictions.
