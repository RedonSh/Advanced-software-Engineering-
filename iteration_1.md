User Management & Onboarding

As a new user, I can create an account using my email and password so that my data can be saved.

As a returning user, I can log in to access my saved recipes.

As a user, I can complete a basic onboarding flow (select 1-3 dietary preferences: e.g., Vegetarian, Gluten-Free, None) so that the app feels slightly tailored to me from the start.

Recipe Core Functionality

As a user, I can view a curated list of recipes on the home screen.

As a user, I can search for recipes by name (e.g., "pasta").

As a user, I can filter the recipe list by my selected dietary preference.

As a user, I can tap on a recipe to view its details: title, image, description, ingredients list, and step-by-step instructions.

As a user following a recipe, I can easily navigate between steps with "Next" and "Previous" buttons.
