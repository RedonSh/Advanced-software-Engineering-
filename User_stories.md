as this [user_stories folder](./)

Keep any other version here as well, e.g. Display current deals, Let user to click on "show-current-deals".

## Priority: 1 (e.g. latest for iteration-1)
Any notes on priority go here. 
Note you may have different priorities at different stages of you project.
Again, keep all changes here for marking.

## Estimation: e.g. 2 days
Any notes on estimation go here. Keep your planning poker game numbers. For example
* Nathan: 8 days (e.g. estimated before iteration-1)
* Radahn: 1 day
* Sabjay: 1 day
* Tobden: 1/2 day

## Assumptions (if any):
